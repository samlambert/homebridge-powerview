# homebridge-powerview

This is a plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).  It allows you to control your [Hunter Douglas PowerView](http://promos.hunterdouglas.ca/powerview-en/) roller blinds server using Siri and the Home app.

**NOTE:** I only have the Gen 1 Powerview hub with the roller shades to test with.  I can't guarantee this will work with any other shades and it is very difficult to update the code to work with hardware I do not have. I am open to anybody willing to contribute code.


# Installation

1.  Install [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) (if not already installed).
2.  Install this plugin copying it to the node_modules folder (manual step until I get it setup in npm).
	Alternatively run the following command:  `npm install -g GvnCampbell/homebridge-powerview`
3.  Update your confiugration file.  See below for a sample.



# Configuration

| `defaultcurrentposition`   | optional, default is 50, sometimes the hub doesn't know where the blinds are, in this case we will set it to a default setting                                                               |
